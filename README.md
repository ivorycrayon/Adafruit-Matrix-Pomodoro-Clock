# Adafruit-Matrix-Pomodoro-Clock

I used this project to learn about embedded systems and managed to create a great little tool.
This functions normally as an LED clock, but it has a mode to help me study using the Pomodoro method. 
I even added a buzzer to notify me of break/work times, along with some beautiful scrolling text and colors.
